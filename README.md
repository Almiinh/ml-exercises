# Compilation of ML Notebooks

This repo is a messy and fuzzy compilation of Machine Learning Notebooks. I'll sort it one day.

- Image classification of cat and dogs, then classification of their breeds
- Time series prediction of occupancy of an office room from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models.
- A comparison of Vector RAG and Graph RAG pipeline to summary scientific article
- Labs to discover: Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning, Perceptron, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning
